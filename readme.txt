== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Querying by post type in the frontend? =

You can create new queries to display posts from a specific post type. This is done via the “post_type” parameter to a WP_Query.

Example:

`<?php $args = array( 'post_type' => 'product', 'posts_per_page' => 10 );
$loop = new WP_Query( $args );
while ( $loop->have_posts() ) : $loop->the_post();
	the_title();
	echo '<div class="entry-content">';
	the_content();
	echo '</div>';
endwhile;?>`

This simply loops through the latest 10 product posts and displays the title and content of them.
